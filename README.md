# Note-Take

## Table of Contets

## Description 
As a developer student I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Motivation
It is a great opportunity to practice what I have learned so far.

## What did I learn?
I learned how to make connections between the front end and the back end.

## Problems
Getting started was quite a challenge . I had to rewatch some of the recordings and watch related youtube videos and search the contents on google.


## Instalation Process
Open the integrated terminal for the document and run node server command , and then open a new browswer in google chrome and type localhost:3001 , click on getting started , on the note title add the task or the activity that you woould like to accomplish and it can be saved as well.
